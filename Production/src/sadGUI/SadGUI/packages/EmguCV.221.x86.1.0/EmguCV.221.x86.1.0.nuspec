    <description>This is a lightweight package (15 MB), with OpenCV 2.2.0. (2010) and can do a lot of OpenCV stuff. Current OpenCV versions is about &gt; 100 MB.

How to install EmguCV in your project:
1 - Install this NuGet package in project
2 - Project -&gt; Add -&gt; Existing Item
3 - Open this packages directory (Probably is (Solution Directory)/packages/EmguCV.221.xXX.X.X)
4 - Open "opencv" directory
5 - Click to display "All Files (*.*)"
6 - Select all *.dll files
7 - Instead clicking on "Add" button, click in the arrow located at this button, and click "Add as Link"

Q: Why add as link instead simply add files?
A: Because in this mode you don't need to put *.dlls in source control, and you don't need to copy *.dlls twice, since they're already in the NuGet package.

You can also notice "haarcascade" folder, these files are for face detection, you can add'em in the same way if you'll use this feature.</description>
